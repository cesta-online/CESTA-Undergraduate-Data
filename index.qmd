project-description: "This is the template project website where we are gathering the data collection, cleaning, visualization, and analyses processes for the student data related to CESTA. You can find 3 different visualizations related to the data below."

author-contributions: "Eren has developed the project further from the previous center managers' works, as well as staff and scholars associated with the Humanities + Design Lab at CESTA. This project wouldn't be possible without the heavy contributions of Sera Wang, the Undergraduate Researcher for CESTA Design."

This article focuses on the years of DH research fellows, the years they were fellows, and their departments/programs.

## Visualizations
Quarto allows the users to run Python and R code directly in the page and get their output. This means that cool and interactive visualizations generated using Python or R can be rendered directly in the page. Please ensure that the essential library dependencies are installed to render the visualizations. For example, the following visualization requires `plotly` library which is installed along with the requirements. Whenever you install a new library, don't forget to add it to `requirements.txt`.

Whenever an interactive visualization is added, an equivalent static image alternative should also be added for the Anthology print version. Refer to the code below.
