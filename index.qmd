![CESTA Students Data](data/imgs/cesta_ug_student_bubbles.png)

The bubbles above represent the majors each CESTA Undergraduate Researchers had over the last 13 years. If a student had two majors, they have been added to the graph above twice. That's why this is the graph of  amounts of majors at CESTA over time.

![CESTA Students Data](data/imgs/cesta_undergraduate_data.png)

Each donut above represnts a Stanford Undergraduate student. The number of colors a donut has is equivalent to the number of times (quarters) they interned with CESTA over their Stanford career. CESTA is proud to say that we have many students work with us over many years in the same or different projects, bringing new insights into the projects. We are also providing the data table below. Please reach out to us if you have any questions.
