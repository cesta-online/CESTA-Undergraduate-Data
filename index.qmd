project-description: "This is the template project website where we are gathering the data collection, cleaning, visualization, and analyses processes for the student data related to CESTA. You can find 3 different visualizations related to the data below."

author-contributions: "Eren has developed the project further from the previous center managers' works, as well as staff and scholars associated with the Humanities + Design Lab at CESTA. This project wouldn't be possible without the heavy contributions of Sera Wang, the Undergraduate Researcher for CESTA Design."

### Tables
In Quarto, tables can be easily created using the pipe table markdown syntax. You can see the example given below.

| Default | Left | Right | Center |
|---------|:-----|------:|:------:|
| 12      | 12   |    12 |   12   |
| 123     | 123  |   123 |  123   |
| 1       | 1    |     1 |   1    |

### Diagrams
Quarto allows natively the authors to create diagrams using Mermaid and Graphviz. Check the [official documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/diagrams.html) for more details.

Below is an example of a Mermaid diagram.
```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[Hard edge] --> B(Round edge)
  B --> C{Decision}
  C --> D[Result one]
  C --> E[Result two]
```

### Videos
In Quarto, videos can be embedded from both locally and remote sources such as YouTube and Vimeo.

### Appendices and Footnotes
Quarto allows the authors to create appendices and footnotes easily.

#### Appendix
In Quarto, appendices can be created using the `.appendix` class. The appendix section is placed at the end of the document and is not included in the table of contents.

##### Appendix Example {.appendix}
Here is an example of an appendix.

#### Footnote
Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
    line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
    multi-paragraph list items.

This article focuses on the computational capabilities of Quarto.  


## Visualizations
Quarto allows the users to run Python and R code directly in the page and get their output. This means that cool and interactive visualizations generated using Python or R can be rendered directly in the page. Please ensure that the essential library dependencies are installed to render the visualizations. For example, the following visualization requires `plotly` library which is installed along with the requirements. Whenever you install a new library, don't forget to add it to `requirements.txt`.

Whenever an interactive visualization is added, an equivalent static image alternative should also be added for the Anthology print version. Refer to the code below.

The content below will appear only in the html version.

### Interactive Plotly Chart
For a demonstration of a Plotly chart, see @fig-example.

```{python}
#| label: fig-example
#| fig-cap: Example Interactive Plotly Chart
import plotly.express as px
df = px.data.iris()
fig = px.scatter(df, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length", color="species",
                 size='petal_length', hover_data=['petal_width'])
fig.show()
```

## Observable
Similar to Python and R code, Quarto is also capable of handling Observable. Please refer to the [official documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/ojs.html) for more details.
